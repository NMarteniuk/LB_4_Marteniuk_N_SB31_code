                    <h2>GitHub Sponsors</h2>
                    <p>In 2019, GitHub launched a new feature called "GitHub Sponsors". This feature allows you to sponsor open source software
                    developers and support the development of open source projects. This is a big win for developers, who can get paid for
                    their work, and for open source projects, which get new development tools.</p>
